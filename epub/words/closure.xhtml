<h1>Closures</h1>
<p>Closures in zeptoforth involve binding an execution token with a single-cell, double-cell, or multi-cell value at a specified, arbitrary address in RAM; this address will then serve as an execution token itself which, when executed, pushes the bound value onto the stack and then execute the bound execution token. The only requirement for the address specified is that it is halfword-aligned.</p>
