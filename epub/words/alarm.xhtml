<h1>Software Alarm Words</h1>
<p>Software alarms are time-based alarms that can be registered with an alarm task, which may be either automatically or explicitly created. Alarm tasks are tasks for which a list of alarms are associated which execute said alarms when the alarms’ times expire. At bootup no alarm tasks are created, but if a default alarm task has not been created at the time that an alarm is first set using a default alarm task, a default alarm task is automatically created with a dictionary size of 320 bytes, a data stack size of 128 bytes, a return stack size of 512 bytes, and a core (relevant to operation on the RP2040) of 0. If a different default alarm task configuration is desired, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">init-default-alarm-task</span></code> is to be used.</p>
<p>Alarms are created with a set delay after a start time, which can be set for convenience to the current time, after which they are triggered, calling their specified execution token, even if the trigger time was in the past when they were created. All times are measured in ticks, which are normally 100 microsecond intervals, with the current time corresponding to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">systick::systick-counter</span></code>. Alarms are one-shot - they must always be manually set again after they are triggered. Alarms also have a set priority; an alarm task takes on the maximum of all the priorities of the currently active alarms associated with it. Alarms have an associated data value, to eliminate the memory cost and complexity of creating a closure for them in many cases. Their execution token has the signature ( data alarm – ) for convenience for accessing their associated data and resetting themselves, for repeated alarms.</p>
<p>Alarms may be dynamically set and unset; note, however, that it is not safe to set an alarm that has already been set and which has not been triggered yet, as setting an alarm assumes that it is uninitialized and initializes it in the process. It is safe to set an alarm which has either been triggered or manually unset again. It is also safe to unset an alarm which has previously been set which has already been triggered or has previously been unset.</p>
<p>Note that all operations are safe to execute from within software alarms, as they do not execute at interrupt time, unlike hardware timers. However, a given software alarm will block any further alarms from executing for the alarm task it is executing under while it executes. If multiple alarms are intended on executing simultaneously multiple alarm tasks are required. However note that alarm tasks are rather heavy-weight since each alarm task instantiates a separate task complete with dictionary, data stack, and return stack.</p>
